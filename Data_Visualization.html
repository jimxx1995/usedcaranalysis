I have relocated to take a job and no longer need the daily driver as I live so close to work. Clean title (in hand), Passes smog, up to date registration, new Optima Yellow top battery, new tires on the front and new brakes all around. Basic road wear, couple dings from asshole people opening their doors into it. But other otherwise in great shape, runs and drives great. Not asking for a fortune, just looking to pass it on to a good new owner. Always serviced from Maserati of La Jolla (down in San Diego) Black leather insides and suede roof lining, I'll update with some pictures when I get a chance. Or you can google them. The interior is very clean (no kids, pets, or smoking)   Cons: Passenger side window needs a new regulator (stuck in the up position), check engine light comes on every once and again due to the coolant not heating up as quick as it should (it's a mystery to me as to why it flags it for being efficient), new brakes squeak like a banshee but stop really well, and it has a little bit of clutch chatter. Dealer says there is approx 25% left of the clutch. Couple dealers in the area can do it for pretty cheap. Hence my lower asking price, trying to be as transparent as possible.   I don't need help selling it. Lowballers and tire kickers don't waste both our time. I'd rather set it on fire and watch it burn then to give it away for whatever low price you offer me.

It has 109k miles, just passed smog and is currently registered. This car is a one off like non other daily driven show car. I have spent countless hours and a lot of money to get it to this point. I don't have to sell it but could use some extra cash to do some custom upgrades to my kitchen.  The interior and exterior are like new. The paint is super glossy and shines like new(you will see why below)The exterior has no dings, dents or noticeable imperfections. The interior has no rips, tears, burns, stains or wear. You won't find a nicer TL than this one anywhere.  It is fully loaded with power windows, locks, mirrors, cruise control, moon roof, power heated seats and more. It also has factory navigation that plays DVD's(DVD player in the trunk that works with the factory deck) steering wheel audio controls, rear air, traction control, fog lights and more. Everything works exactly as it should including all windows.  It is mechanically perfect. This Acura runs and drives amazing. There are no mechanical issues or leaks of any kind. The engine, transmission, brakes and alignment are as solid as it gets. This car needs nothing any time soon. The engine is very quite and the transmission shifts flawlessly.  Now on to the custom goodies;  The car was painted a year ago using only the best products from PPG. I work for one of the many Cooks Collision Paint Centers as their lead painter. If you know Cooks then you know they won't do a complete paint job for less than $6,500. The paint job done on this car would run over $10,000 being as it used to be Carbon Gray Pearl and has been completely changed over to 2013 Cadillac CTS Crystal Red Tintcoat. Everything was removed from the car and painted while off of it. All door jambs, under hood, fender jambs, trunk jambs, etc... were changed over to the CTS red. No corners were cut. I have easily over 70 hours into this paint job including remove/reinstall, preparation, disassembly, prime, paint, wet sand and buffing.  While prepping/painting the car I installed a TL Type S spoiler, Type S grill, front and rear A-spec lips, factory mud guards painted to match(I had to completely modify the rear mud guards to fit the A-spec rear lip)A-spec fog lights with JDM style orange lenses, clear projector headlights(no amber in corners), clear side markes, JDM reverse light cut into the rear bumper, etc...I also installed red Acura emblems front to back, a Type-R logo and DOHC VTEC stickers on the front doors(came on 99-00 Civic SI). I painted the rain gutters, grill insert and a few other trim pieces that originally came black as well.  The car is sitting on newer 18x9.5 BBS wheels that have been painted orange flash(PPG T4040) with brand new stretched 205 40 18 tires. Is has a hella flush offset as you can see in the pictures. It is lowered with Eibach race line springs and ready to be stanced once you buy front/rear camber kits to do so.  The fenders and rear quarter panels were partially rolled for clearance(the wheels/tires make no contact with the fenders at all). It was done the right way(before paint)with no imperfections to the body. I have seen so many people try to do this themselves and who completely ruin their quarter panels and fenders.Thus the reason they started making fender flares again. LMAO  The car didn't come factory with Navigation. I just had to have it though so I bought the entire kit to install it for $2,000 from a guy on Ebay. He sells the factory kits with a custom harness and DVD player. Video can be watched while driving and all steering wheel functions are still functional. I also installed a rear camera which isn't a factory option on the TL's. It is mounted in the same spot as all factory cars and works in conjunction with the NAVI head unit.  I have customized many Honda's over the years. I don't cut corners on anything I do. I take pride in my work. I have spent well over 120 hours worth of my own time getting this car to where it is today. I put a lot of detail into my custom cars. This car can easily be used as a daily driver. It is not too low even with the lip kits on it. That is as long as you drive it like you would any lowered car.  BTW my car is salvaged. I have all frame spec measurements and can tell you that this car is cleaner than any clean title TL you will find. I didn't buy it already repaired being as I am very picky and don't trust other peoples work. I am the one who did all of the repairs back to factory specifications. I am willing to let you take it to any body shop or Honda/Acura dealership to have it inspected. I have nothing to hide and they will find nothing wrong!  The price is very fair and firm. Again, I don't have to sell this car. If I do the money is going into my kitchen. Go buy a clean title, low mileage TL for $9,000-$10,000 and invest $17,000 after buying it if you don't want to buy mine. Good things aren't cheap and cheap things are rarely ever good.

I moved a lot closer to work, so no longer need this car, hopefully I can find a good home to take care of her and continue her journey with you.  It is a Perfect car for commuting (30+ MPG on freeway), or for your/your child's first car, something safe and easy to learn and drive on, doesn't hurt as much when have a little fender bender, due to its age, replacement part's price is about the same as Toyota parts.  5000 miles per oil change.

Interior I've maintained it the best I could, is clean and well taken care of. Car have pretty low miles given its age Never been abused.

Not because I want to but because I have to. I bought the truck at auction as a theft recovery. I registered the truck  before I had the truck smogged so the license plate was not released and was given a four month registration which was up in December. The truck runs great with lots of power. Currently has 180k miles on it. I had a DVD player installed with Rockford Fosgate 6.5\" speakers, 300 watt kicker amp and a 12\" self powered subwoofer.   The issues: Passenger side window needs a new actuator so it does not roll down at the moment. The passenger side door also has a dent in the lower half. The rear bumper is bent a little bit on driver's side and the driver's side front bumper has a crack.   The good:  Front differential was replaced which was damaged at purchase. Truck has new CV axles, wheel hubs, lower ball joints, upper control arms with ball joints, tie rod ends and sway bar connectors on both driver and passenger side. Also the solenoid pack in the transmission is new.         I love this truck and would love nothing more to keep it. However, I am up to my eyeballs in debt and have no choice. I have to resort to a junker for work.       Text would be the best way to get a hold of me.

The interior is very clean (no kids, pets, or smoking)   Cons: Passenger side window needs a new regulator (stuck in the up position), check engine light comes on every once and again due to the coolant not heating up as quick as it should (it's a mystery to me as to why it flags it for being efficient), new brakes squeak like a banshee but stop really well, and it has a little bit of clutch chatter. Dealer says there is approx 25% left of the clutch. Couple dealers in the area can do it for pretty cheap. Hence my lower asking price, trying to be as transparent as possible.

It has 109k miles, just passed smog and is currently registered. This car is a one off like non other daily driven show car. I have spent countless hours and a lot of money to get it to this point. I don't have to sell it but could use some extra cash to do some custom upgrades to my kitchen.  The interior and exterior are like new. The paint is super glossy and shines like new(you will see why below)The exterior has no dings, dents or noticeable imperfections. The interior has no rips, tears, burns, stains or wear. You won't find a nicer TL than this one anywhere.  It is fully loaded with power windows, locks, mirrors, cruise control, moon roof, power heated seats and more. It also has factory navigation that plays DVD's(DVD player in the trunk that works with the factory deck) steering wheel audio controls, rear air, traction control, fog lights and more. Everything works exactly as it should including all windows.  It is mechanically perfect. This Acura runs and drives amazing. There are no mechanical issues or leaks of any kind. The engine, transmission, brakes and alignment are as solid as it gets. This car needs nothing any time soon. The engine is very quite and the transmission shifts flawlessly.  Now on to the custom goodies;  The car was painted a year ago using only the best products from PPG. I work for one of the many Cooks Collision Paint Centers as their lead painter. If you know Cooks then you know they won't do a complete paint job for less than $6,500. The paint job done on this car would run over $10,000 being as it used to be Carbon Gray Pearl and has been completely changed over to 2013 Cadillac CTS Crystal Red Tintcoat. Everything was removed from the car and painted while off of it. All door jambs, under hood, fender jambs, trunk jambs, etc... were changed over to the CTS red. No corners were cut. I have easily over 70 hours into this paint job including remove/reinstall, preparation, disassembly, prime, paint, wet sand and buffing.  While prepping/painting the car I installed a TL Type S spoiler, Type S grill, front and rear A-spec lips, factory mud guards painted to match(I had to completely modify the rear mud guards to fit the A-spec rear lip)A-spec fog lights with JDM style orange lenses, clear projector headlights(no amber in corners), clear side markes, JDM reverse light cut into the rear bumper, etc...I also installed red Acura emblems front to back, a Type-R logo and DOHC VTEC stickers on the front doors(came on 99-00 Civic SI). I painted the rain gutters, grill insert and a few other trim pieces that originally came black as well.  The car is sitting on newer 18x9.5 BBS wheels that have been painted orange flash(PPG T4040) with brand new stretched 205 40 18 tires. Is has a hella flush offset as you can see in the pictures. It is lowered with Eibach race line springs and ready to be stanced once you buy front/rear camber kits to do so.  The fenders and rear quarter panels were partially rolled for clearance(the wheels/tires make no contact with the fenders at all). It was done the right way(before paint)with no imperfections to the body. I have seen so many people try to do this themselves and who completely ruin their quarter panels and fenders.Thus the reason they started making fender flares again. LMAO  The car didn't come factory with Navigation. I just had to have it though so I bought the entire kit to install it for $2,000 from a guy on Ebay. He sells the factory kits with a custom harness and DVD player. Video can be watched while driving and all steering wheel functions are still functional. I also installed a rear camera which isn't a factory option on the TL's. It is mounted in the same spot as all factory cars and works in conjunction with the NAVI head unit.  I have customized many Honda's over the years. I don't cut corners on anything I do. I take pride in my work. I have spent well over 120 hours worth of my own time getting this car to where it is today. I put a lot of detail into my custom cars. This car can easily be used as a daily driver. It is not too low even with the lip kits on it. That is as long as you drive it like you would any lowered car.  BTW my car is salvaged. I have all frame spec measurements and can tell you that this car is cleaner than any clean title TL you will find. I didn't buy it already repaired being as I am very picky and don't trust other peoples work. I am the one who did all of the repairs back to factory specifications. I am willing to let you take it to any body shop or Honda/Acura dealership to have it inspected. I have nothing to hide and they will find nothing wrong!  The price is very fair and firm. Again, I don't have to sell this car. If I do the money is going into my kitchen. Go buy a clean title, low mileage TL for $9,000-$10,000 and invest $17,000 after buying it if you don't want to buy mine. Good things aren't cheap and cheap things are rarely ever good.

I moved a lot closer to work, so no longer need this car, hopefully I can find a good home to take care of her and continue her journey with you.  It is a Perfect car for commuting (30+ MPG on freeway), or for your/your child's first car, something safe and easy to learn and drive on, doesn't hurt as much when have a little fender bender, due to its age, replacement part's price is about the same as Toyota parts.  5000 miles per oil change. Tires, Brakes changed at 128,000 miles. Smog the car last year around November.  Car have aftermarket cat back exhaust, muffler. aftermarket wheels.

Interior I've maintained it the best I could, is clean and well taken care of. Car have pretty low miles given its age Never been abused.  Cons: When I first got it, car is in a bit of a rough shape, I've put in quite some time to bring it back, but some of the stuff I just can't do anything.  I don't want to lie to you and waste your trip here, I've listed out of what's not great about the car.  Hood, partial roof have oxidation on the paint. Head light on the right- main light is out. Head light on the left - Signal light is out. Passenger Front Wheel is bent, could be fix, but I had no time to do it, so I dealt with it since it doesn't effect driving. Some wear and tare on driver seat. One of the tire sensor is malfunction, so tire pressure light is on the whole time. Cup Holders does not open.  **First Gear is Rough, jerks a little when slowing down going back to first gear** (Took it to BMW dealer couple times, but they still couldn't tell me why, only tells me is common for older BMW)  Car carries Nevada License Plate, I will take care of the registration for you at the time of purchase.

Not because I want to but because I have to. I bought the truck at auction as a theft recovery. I registered the truck  before I had the truck smogged so the license plate was not released and was given a four month registration which was up in December. The truck runs great with lots of power. Currently has 180k miles on it. I had a DVD player installed with Rockford Fosgate 6.5\" speakers, 300 watt kicker amp and a 12\" self powered subwoofer.   The issues: Passenger side window needs a new actuator so it does not roll down at the moment. The passenger side door also has a dent in the lower half. The rear bumper is bent a little bit on driver's side and the driver's side front bumper has a crack.   The good:  Front differential was replaced which was damaged at purchase. Truck has new CV axles, wheel hubs, lower ball joints, upper control arms with ball joints, tie rod ends and sway bar connectors on both driver and passenger side. Also the solenoid pack in the transmission is new.         I love this truck and would love nothing more to keep it. However, I am up to my eyeballs in debt and have no choice. I have to resort to a junker for work.       Text would be the best way to get a hold of me. If you call I won't recognize the number and think your a bill collector and probably won't answer.","In excellent condition  Has 72,000 miles show contact info   21,000 OBO","Hey !
